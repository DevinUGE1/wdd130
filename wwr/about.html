                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>Nestled in the green canyons of the Andes, the small town of Huanta whispered promises of adventure to every traveler who passed through.
                    <br>For Sofia, a photojournalist from Spain, it was just a stop on the map—until she heard the rush of the river.<br>
                    Locals spoke of the "Yaku Ñawi", the river's ancient soul. They said if you truly listened, the water would tell its story.
                    <br>Curious and restless, Sofia signed up with Rafting Huanta, a small team led by Mateo, a native guide with sun-worn hands and a deep respect for the river.<br>
                    “This river doesn't follow us—we follow it,” he said with a smile as they pushed off into the current.<br>
                    The raft danced over waves, twisted between rocks, and surged through narrow canyons.<br>Laughter and shouts echoed through the valley as water sprayed across their faces.
                    Sofia felt her heart sync with the beat of the river, wild and free.
                    Then came the silence—between rapids, a calm stretch. <br>Mateo pointed at a cliff wall where ancient petroglyphs marked the stone.
                    <br>“Our ancestors called this place 'the breath of the earth,’” he said. “Rafting here isn't just sport... it's connection.”
                    By the end of the day, soaked and exhilarated, Sofia knew her story had changed. 
                    <br>Huanta was no longer just a stop. It was a rhythm, a feeling—a place where the river carries your spirit somewhere deeper.
                    And so, with a camera full of water and a heart full of wonder, she stayed.</p>
